A tiny ladybug named Dot loved to play in the garden. She spent her days buzzing from flower to flower, collecting yummy pollen for her breakfast. One sunny morning, Dot met a grumpy caterpillar named Cletus. Cletus was sulking under a large leaf. Dot, being a kind ladybug, asked Cletus what was wrong. Cletus explained he was feeling lonely and wished he had a friend. Dot, with a twinkle in her eye, offered to be Cletus's friend. Together, they explored the garden, making new friends and enjoying the sunny days. From that day on, Dot and Cletus were the best of friends, proving that even the smallest of creatures can find happiness and friendship.
